# This is an abstract data type that maintains a pool of "active" elements that are a subset of the
# n-elements.  The elements are referenced by their elemId from 0 to n-1.
#
# When popping elements from the pool an arbitrary element its chosen (i.e., not necessary the last one
# added, though there is a tendency to pop elements that were added more recently before popping elements
# there were added earlier).  This lack of order of the popping makes all the operations O(1), the memory
# needed for the elemId is O(n) rather than O(m) (where m is the number of active elements).  This is simular
# to the trade made by hashing algorithms.  But the extra memory overhead is significantly less than for
# hashing.  In addition, the locality of reference is much better for this algorithm than for hashing.  In
# fact the cashing affects should be better for this algorithm than for either the O(ln(n)) approach or the
# hashing approach.  Nevertheless, for some parameters, workload and machines, when m << n, this might be
# slower than the O(ln(n)) method because of memory affects (e.g., cacheing and paging).
